# freecodecamp Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

### Summary
This is my submission for the freecodecamp project under the ***"Data Analysis with Python"*** certification program. A link to the project page can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator).

### Goal
The goal of this project is to transform a list of 9 numbers to a 3x3 matrix and then calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, max and min. Two modules were created, ***mean_var_std.py*** and ***test_module.py***. The latter being a test case to ensure the main module is working properly.
